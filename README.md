# CleanTrack Uganda Backend

CleanTrack Uganda is a student-learning waste management API built with Node.js, Express.js, MariaDB/MySQL, JWT authentication, bcrypt password hashing, and Multer image uploads.

## Tech Stack

- Node.js and Express.js for the API server
- MariaDB/MySQL for persistent data
- `mysql2/promise` for database queries
- JWT for protected routes
- bcrypt for password hashing
- Multer for pickup and proof photo uploads

## Folder Structure

- `config/db.js` creates the MariaDB connection pool.
- `controllers/` contains request logic and database queries.
- `middleware/` contains JWT authentication, role checks, and upload configuration.
- `routes/` maps API URLs to controller functions.
- `uploads/` stores uploaded pickup and proof photos.
- `database/schema.sql` creates tables.
- `database/seed.sql` inserts demo learning data.
- `server.js` configures Express and mounts all route files.

## Database Setup

1. Install and start MariaDB/MySQL.
2. Create or choose a database user with permission to create databases.
3. Copy the environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
4. Update `.env` with your real database credentials.
5. Create the schema and seed the demo records:
   ```bash
   npm run db:setup
   ```

For the default local setup used in this project, the MariaDB/MySQL username and password are both `root`:

```env
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=root
```

`npm run db:setup` runs both `database/schema.sql` and `database/seed.sql`. The schema file recreates the `cleantrack_uganda` database, so do not run it against data you need to keep.

Manual alternative:

```bash
mysql -u your_user -p < database/schema.sql
mysql -u your_user -p cleantrack_uganda < database/seed.sql
```

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Important values:

- `DB_HOST`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, `DB_NAME` connect to MariaDB/MySQL.
- `JWT_SECRET` signs login tokens.
- `FRONTEND_URL` controls CORS access from the React app.

## Run Backend

```bash
npm install
cp .env.example .env
npm run db:setup
npm run dev
```

The API runs at `http://localhost:5000`.

If port `5000` is already in use, change `PORT` in `.env`, for example:

```env
PORT=5002
```

Then update the frontend `VITE_API_URL` to match.

Quick health check:

```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/
```

Expected response:

```json
{ "message": "CleanTrack Uganda API is running" }
```

## CORS Setup

The backend allows the default Vite frontend origins:

- `http://localhost:5173`
- `http://127.0.0.1:5173`
- `http://localhost:5174`
- `http://127.0.0.1:5174`

If your frontend runs somewhere else, set `FRONTEND_URL` in `.env`, then restart the backend.

## API Endpoints

Auth:

- `POST /api/auth/register`
- `POST /api/auth/login`
- `GET /api/auth/me`

Customer locations:

- `POST /api/locations`
- `GET /api/locations/my-locations`
- `GET /api/locations/:id`
- `PUT /api/locations/:id`
- `DELETE /api/locations/:id`

Pickup requests:

- `POST /api/pickups`
- `GET /api/pickups/my-requests`
- `GET /api/pickups/:id`
- `PUT /api/pickups/:id/cancel`
- `GET /api/pickups/pending/all`

Assignments:

- `POST /api/assignments`
- `GET /api/assignments/driver/my-jobs`
- `GET /api/assignments/company/my-jobs`
- `PUT /api/assignments/:id/status`
- `PUT /api/assignments/:id/complete`
- `PUT /api/assignments/:id/failed`

Companies, trucks, categories, feedback, and admin routes are implemented in their matching `routes/` and `controllers/` files.

## Default Accounts

All seed accounts use password `password123`.

- Admin: `admin@cleantrack.ug`
- Customer: `customer@cleantrack.ug`
- Driver: `driver1@cleantrack.ug`
- Manager: `manager@greenroute.ug`

## JWT Authentication

When a user logs in, the backend signs a JWT containing the user id and role. Protected routes use `authMiddleware.js` to verify the token, load the current user from the database, and reject inactive accounts.

## Role-Based Access Control

`roleMiddleware.js` checks `req.user.role` before a request reaches a controller. For example, customers can report bins, drivers can update assigned jobs, managers can assign pickups, and admins can view system-wide records.

## Image Uploads

Multer stores customer bin photos in `uploads/pickup-photos/` and driver proof photos in `uploads/proof-photos/`. The backend serves `/uploads` statically so React can display saved images.

## How the Frontend Talks to the Backend

The React frontend uses Axios service files. After login, the JWT is stored in `localStorage`; the Axios interceptor attaches it as `Authorization: Bearer <token>` for protected API requests.

## Repository Notes

This folder is its own Git repository. `node_modules/`, `.env`, generated logs, and uploaded photos are ignored. The empty upload folders are kept with `.gitkeep` files so students can see where images are stored.

## New Feature: Recurring Pickup Schedules

This extension adds customer-controlled recurring pickup schedules and an admin approval workflow. Customers set a weekly schedule, admins approve or reject it, and approved schedules can be turned into real pickup requests on the matching day.

### New Database Table

- `pickup_schedules` — stores each customer's recurring schedule (day of week, location, waste type, bin level, status, and admin review fields).
- Run `database/migrate_schedules.sql` to add it to an existing database, or `npm run db:setup` to rebuild everything from `database/schema.sql`.

### New API Endpoints

Customer:

- `POST /api/schedules` — create a schedule (own locations only)
- `GET  /api/schedules/my-schedules` — list the logged-in customer's schedules
- `DELETE /api/schedules/:id` — cancel a pending schedule the customer owns

Admin:

- `GET  /api/schedules/admin/list?status=pending|approved|rejected` — filter schedules by status
- `PUT  /api/schedules/admin/:id/status` — approve or reject a schedule (`{ "status": "approved", "admin_note": "" }`)
- `POST /api/schedules/admin/generate-pickups` — create pickup requests for all approved schedules whose `day_of_week` matches today; duplicates for the same customer/location/waste on the same date are skipped

### Access Control

Every endpoint uses the existing `protect` middleware, and `allowRoles` restricts each route to the correct role. Customers can only act on their own locations and schedules; admin endpoints return `403` for non-admins.# CleanTrack Backend — Learning Notes
